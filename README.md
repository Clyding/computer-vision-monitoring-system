# computer-vision-monitoring-system
This project uses Computer Vision and AI to detect and track movement of people

The code is simply a monitoring system. It uses openCV audio and sound recognition
libraries to activate the camera to start the monitoring process whenever there is 
a loud shout or a scream for help. It activates the camera which automatically 
sends notification to emergency contacts and correspondents on our database.
